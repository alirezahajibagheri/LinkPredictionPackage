# LinkPredictionPackage

The aim of this project is to study the structure of different types of networks that emerge in massively multi-player online games. Travian is a popular browser-based real-time strategy game with more than 5 million players. Players form alliances of up to 60 members under a leader or a leadership team. Each game cycle lasts a fixed period (a few months).

This network dataset was designed for studying multiplex network problems, in particular community detection since the ground truth for alliance membership is available. It was extracted from data from a study of virtual organizations conducted by researchers across several institutions, including the University of Arkansas. Data was collected from a 3x server (with a 3.5 month game cycle) based in Germany. These networks are from a 30 day game period.
